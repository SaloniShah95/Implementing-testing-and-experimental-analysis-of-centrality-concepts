1) what nodes have more number of contacts? - degree centrality
2) how to spread information productively throughout the network? - closeness gives nodes with the short distance to other nodes
3) Who is well connected throughout the network? if node is located on as many of the shortest paths as possible between pairs of other nodes - betweeness
4) people with highly influencial friends. - eigen vector centrality.

- Suppose we take facebook subgraphs of all the people belonging to facebook groups A and B
1) find well connected people who are a part of group A and B 
2) What nodes will contribute to 'fast' propogation of information about group A spread to people of group B or vice-versa? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find betweeness hubs.
3) Who are the influencial\well-recommended people across groups A and B? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find Eigen hubs.
4) What nodes will contribute to 'vast' propogation of information about group A spread to people of group B or vice-versa? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find closeness hubs.
