1) what nodes have more number of contacts? - degree centrality

2) how to spread information productively throughout the network? - closeness gives nodes with the short distance to other nodes

3) Who mediates information throughout the network? if node is located on as many of the shortest paths as possible between pairs of other nodes - betweeness
Should be closeness centrality according to me. bridge concept.

4) people with highly influencial friends. - eigen vector centrality.

- Suppose we take facebook subgraphs of all the people belonging to facebook groups A and B
1) find well connected people who are a part of group A and B
Shouldn't degree centrality of composition give us this answer? 

2) What nodes will contribute to 'fast' propogation of information about group A spread to people of group B or vice-versa? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find closeness hubs.

3) Who are the influencial\well-recommended people across groups A and B? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find Eigen hubs.

4) What nodes will contribute to mediation of propogation of information about group A spread to people of group B or vice-versa? 
Solution: take AND of layers A and B and find closeness hubs.
and if it has the highest betweenness, it would mean that it has high influence on the control over netweork passing between the 2 groups
suppose if I remove that node from one of the groups,it would disrupt information passing between the 2 groups.


5) why naive and should not be used and what is it?
To find hubs in the composition of the two layers, one way is to find the hubs of layer A, then find the hubs of layer B and then take the AND of these
two sets. This way is ineffective because it leads to many false positives and false negatives

inferences from the FB-CM graph plot:
1) 
CM values for betweenness normalized by 2/((n-1)(n-2))
CM values for closeness is normalized by the sum of minimum possible distances n-1.
degree centrality values are normalized by dividing by the maximum possible degree in a simple graph n-1 where n is the number of nodes in G\
 
 betweenness < Eigen < 	degree < closeness
 
2)
for normalization betweenness is divided by order(n^2). hence the values are the least
whereas,for normalization of degree and closeness is done by order (n) term. where n = total number of nodes.

3) difference of hubs

venn diagram
for diff graphs - what over lap?
naive accuracy - why not good values?
OR and AND
graph frst and then venn 

good accuracy - with all the info sustained
